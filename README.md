## Projects and Descriptions

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm to Find Shortest Path**
   - A program that implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest path between vertices in a network.

2. **DNS Using Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Simulation of a simple DNS server to resolve the IP address for a given domain name using Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Line Coding Techniques**
   - Analysis of various line coding techniques used for data transmission of a digital signal over a transmission line.

4. **Routing Algorithms**
   - Implementation of routing tables using:
     - Distance Vector Routing
     - Link State Routing algorithms

5. **TCP-IP Client-Server Model**
   - A program using TCP/IP sockets:
     - The client sends the name of a file.
     - The server retrieves the contents of the file (if it exists) and sends them back to the client.
     - IPC mechanisms like message queues or FIFOs are used.

6. **Web Server Using Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Implementation of a web server to fetch a URL request and display the home page in the browser.
